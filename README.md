# APMM_Assignment_WebAPI
This assessment is to build an ASP.NET Core web API for an internal dashboard application to track container transport prices for specific geographical routes, referred to as voyages. More specifically, your API needs an endpoint that returns the last 10 prices for containers booked on a given voyage and an endpoint through which you can register a new booking price. The application should support at least 3 different currencies of your choice. You don't need to connect to an online service to get the latest currency rates - it is fine to use hard-coded exchange rates
